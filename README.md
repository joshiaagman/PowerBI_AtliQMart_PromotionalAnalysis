# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analytics

## Project Overview
AtliQ Mart, a prominent retail chain with over 50 supermarkets in southern India, executed extensive promotions during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 on their AtliQ branded products. To evaluate the effectiveness of these promotions, Sales Director Bruce Haryali has tasked Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ Mart, with this analysis. The analytics manager, Tony, is currently engaged in another critical project.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart aims to assess the impact of its recent promotional activities to determine which promotions were effective and which were not. The key metrics of interest include:
- **Quantity Sold**: Number of units sold during the promotion.
- **Incremental Revenue**: Additional revenue generated due to the promotion.
- **Incremental Units**: Additional units sold compared to the pre-promotion period.
- **Promotion Type Analysis**: Evaluation of different promotion types and their impact on sales.

## Objectives
1. **Promotion Performance Analysis**: Identify which promotions were successful and which were not.
2. **Store Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the impact of promotions on individual store performance.
3. **Category and Product Analysis**: Analyze top and bottom products and categories based on promotional performance.
4. **Balance Analysis**: Examine the relationship between incremental units sold and incremental revenue for different promotions.
